The Conservatives under Prime Minister Stephen Harper face a lagging economy, low approvals and multiple scandals but a large warchest. The Liberals under Papineau MP and Son of Former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Justin Trudeau are facing an uphill battle. With only 36 MP’s and polling in third Trudeau will need an almost flawless campaign to even have a shot of winning. And then there is Thomas Mulcair. Elected NDP leader in 2012 after longtime leader Jack Layton's passing Mulcair leads an NDP mostly made up of Quebecers. After the Alberta NDP’s victory in the Spring election the Federal party jumped into a slight lead over conservatives by the early summer. Will Harper win a fourth mandate or Can Mulcair form the first NDP government, and can the darkhorse Liberals make the ultimate comeback. \n",

Mulcair won the NDP leadership in 2012 after the Passing of Jack Layton defeating NDP president Brian Topp on the fourth ballot. Under his leadership Mulcair has continued pushing the party to the center like his predecessor. Even though Mulcair’s NDP has polled in the low 20s through the past few years, recent success for the Alberta NDP and good media attention has seen the party climb to first place in the polling.
